> I have opened the tool 'EXOscada View Designer', but I cannot find File/Import feature?

You have opened the wrong tool. 'EXOscada View Designer' is the old tool, make sure you open and use 'View Designer'.

> In EXOscada I used a swf file as a background, in the coversion process it has renamed the reference with an svg extension, why?

Since Arrigo BMS doesn't support swf files, you have to use svg files instead. The conversion process will assist you by changing the references of all your swf files to svg. To create an svg file simply open your swf file in your tool where it was made and re-save it as a svg file.
