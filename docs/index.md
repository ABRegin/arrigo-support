# 2022-03-25 Major stability issues on www.arrigo.se
We have issues with prognosis and consumption calculations in EMS module on arrigo.se. This affects all clients. We are working on a solution.
Prognosis calculation and consumption calculations will be offline until the problem is resolved.
No data will be lost, we can backtrack and recalculate everything.
If you need more details, please send an email to arrigosupport@rssoftware.se
